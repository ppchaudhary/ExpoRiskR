Description: ExpoRiskR provides tools for exposure-aware multi-omics risk modeling
    in translational and environmental health studies. The package aligns sample
    identifiers across exposure and multi-omics blocks, performs lightweight
    preprocessing, and fits exposure-adjusted association models to build
    interpretable microbe–metabolite networks. It also computes simple exposure
    perturbation summaries and generates publication-ready visualizations.
    Workflows support both matrix-based inputs and SummarizedExperiment objects.
